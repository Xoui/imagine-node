# Imagine-node

Hi! I'm a student in school who likes coding. I am working on a image ai (might go commercial we will see about that) I maintain imagine because just saying imagine-node is like ðŸ—£:fire: :fire: :fire: ****we bout to get out of kindergarten with this one**** but imagines pretty fast. skidded the css sort of from uv. same thing wit the go feature from interstellar (no ban me bubbo pls). 


# Deploying
Theres many ways to deploy.
I reccomend vercel cuz u can make a lot of links (using the deploy100)

# BYOD
This is kinda ez

   `git clone https://github.com/xoui/imagine-node`
   `cd imagine-node`
   `npm i && npm start`
   and your pretty much finished so i guess just run
   `git pull `from time to time to keep it updated
